Omark is the new form of taking attendance in class, its captures a classroom and determines which student is in class and which student isn't

# Overview
The Omark Program was written with fast use in mind. It provides the following key features

In the following paragraphs, I am going to describe how you can get and use Omark.

## Initialize Omark
First, let's create a new Omark object. For this , just provide the students in a text file and a folder of all the students image with the names saved as the same name stored in the text file.
